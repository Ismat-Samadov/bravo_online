## 1. Product Portfolio Strategy

### Finding: Concentrated Product Distribution

![Category Portfolio](charts/01_category_portfolio.png)

**What This Shows:**
The top 15 product categories represent the core of Bravo's market strategy, with most categories maintaining around 50 products each. This indicates a deliberate portfolio curation strategy rather than unlimited SKU expansion.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Inventory Efficiency**: Controlled SKU counts reduce complexity and storage costs
- **Category Focus**: Resources can be concentrated on high-performing categories
- **Supplier Negotiations**: Fewer SKUs per category may indicate strategic vendor partnerships

**Strategic Implications:**
1. Categories with 50+ products may benefit from sub-segmentation analysis
2. Smaller categories could represent growth opportunities or test markets
3. Portfolio balance suggests mature category management practices

---

## 2. Revenue Opportunity by Market Segment

### Finding: Strong Economy and Standard Tier Dominance

![Pricing Tiers](charts/02_pricing_tiers.png)

**What This Shows:**
The majority of products (1,602 items, 33%) fall in the 1-3 AZN "Economy" tier, followed by 1,024 products (21%) in the 5-10 AZN "Premium" range. Only 37 products exceed 50 AZN.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Mass Market Focus**: The portfolio is optimized for everyday consumer spending
- **Accessibility**: Low to mid-price concentration maximizes customer reach
- **Revenue Balance**: The 5-10 AZN segment represents higher margins with significant volume

**Strategic Recommendations:**
1. **Expand the 5-10 AZN tier**: This "Premium" segment offers the best balance of margin and volume
2. **Luxury Category Development**: Only 37 products >50 AZN suggests opportunity for high-margin expansion
3. **Bundle Strategies**: Combine economy items with premium products to increase average basket value

---

## 3. Premium Market Positioning

### Finding: Clear High-Value Category Hierarchy

![Premium Categories](charts/03_premium_categories.png)

**What This Shows:**
Elite alcoholic beverages command the highest average prices (55.87 AZN for premium spirits, 51.21 AZN for whiskeys), followed by specialty food items. The top 12 categories show significant price differentiation.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Margin Opportunities**: These categories likely deliver the highest profit margins
- **Market Positioning**: Demonstrates capability to serve premium customer segments
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Premium offerings distinguish Bravo from discount competitors

**Business Actions:**
1. **Enhance Premium Visibility**: Feature high-value categories prominently in-store and online
2. **Curated Collections**: Create premium bundles (e.g., "Gourmet Evening" sets)
3. **Customer Segmentation**: Develop loyalty programs targeting premium category shoppers
4. **Marketing Investment**: Premium categories justify higher advertising spend due to better margins

---

## 4. Promotional Strategy Effectiveness

### Finding: Active but Measured Discount Approach

![Discount Strategy](charts/04_discount_strategy.png)

**What This Shows:**
25.7% of products are on promotion with an average discount of 25.3%. The majority of discounts fall in the 20-40% range, with strategic high-impact discounts (>40%) on select items.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Controlled Margin Erosion**: 74% of products maintain full pricing power
- **Customer Expectations**: Consistent 20-30% discounts create predictable savings
- **Traffic Drivers**: Deep discounts (40%+) on 100+ products drive store visits

**Strategic Implications:**
1. **Current strategy is sustainable**: 25% promotional coverage balances revenue and customer value
2. **Discount optimization opportunity**: Test 20-25% range vs. 25-30% for similar conversion
3. **Rotation strategy**: Ensure promotional items rotate to prevent customer discount dependency
4. **Category-specific discounts**: Target promotions to low-margin, high-velocity categories

---

## 5. Inventory Risk Management

### Finding: Excellent Stock Health with Minimal Risk

![Stock Risk Assessment](charts/05_stock_risk.png)

**What This Shows:**
99.5% stock availability with only 24 products out of stock. However, 2,426 products (50.4%) are in low stock status (<10 units), indicating lean inventory management.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Capital Efficiency**: Low inventory levels minimize working capital requirements
- **Risk Exposure**: 50% of products at risk of stockout could impact revenue
- **Customer Satisfaction**: High availability (99.5%) maintains shopping experience quality

**Critical Actions Required:**
1. **Immediate Restocking**: Prioritize the 24 out-of-stock items—each represents lost revenue
2. **Low-Stock Monitoring**: Implement automated alerts for the 2,426 low-stock products
3. **Demand Forecasting**: Invest in predictive analytics to optimize reorder points
4. **Safety Stock Review**: Categories with frequent stockouts need higher minimums
5. **Supplier Performance**: Evaluate lead times for categories with persistent low stock

---

## 6. Category Performance Matrix

### Finding: High-Volume Categories Cluster in Mid-Price Range

![Category Performance Matrix](charts/06_category_performance_matrix.png)

**What This Shows:**
Categories with 30-50 products dominate the mid-price range (3-10 AZN). There's a clear inverse relationship: higher product volume correlates with lower average prices.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Revenue Dynamics**: Volume leaders are not premium categories—different growth strategies needed
- **Market Coverage**: Mid-price categories offer scale advantages
- **Strategic Gaps**: Few categories combine high volume AND high price

**Business Opportunities:**
1. **Volume Leaders**: These categories are traffic drivers—ensure competitive pricing
2. **Premium Volume Gap**: Opportunity to develop high-volume premium categories
3. **Category Roles**: Assign clear roles (traffic, margin, seasonal) to each category
4. **Assortment Optimization**: Small, high-price categories may not justify shelf space

---

## 7. Competitive Market Positioning

### Finding: Clear Budget and Premium Segmentation

![Competitive Positioning](charts/07_competitive_positioning.png)

**What This Shows:**
Sharp contrast between budget categories (coffee mixes at 0.47 AZN average) and premium categories (elite spirits at 55.87 AZN average). This demonstrates deliberate market segmentation.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Customer Accessibility**: Budget categories ensure no price barrier to entry
- **Trade-Up Opportunities**: Wide price range allows customer journey from budget to premium
- **Competitive Defense**: Budget pricing blocks discount competitors; premium pricing competes with specialty stores

**Market Strategy:**
1. **Protect Budget Position**: Maintain aggressive pricing in entry categories
2. **Premium Differentiation**: Invest in exclusive products for premium categories
3. **Cross-Shopping**: Promote premium alternatives when customers buy budget items
4. **Market Perception**: Balance "affordable" and "quality" messaging

---

## 8. Revenue Concentration Analysis

### Finding: Revenue Potential Concentrated in Select Categories

![Revenue Concentration](charts/08_revenue_concentration.png)

**What This Shows:**
Revenue potential (calculated as product volume × average price) reveals that categories like alcoholic beverages, confectionery, and dairy products drive disproportionate revenue opportunity despite not having the most products.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Resource Allocation**: These categories deserve premium shelf space and marketing budget
- **Negotiating Power**: High-revenue categories warrant direct supplier relationships
- **Strategic Protection**: Competitors will target these categories—defend aggressively

**Executive Actions:**
1. **Shelf Space Optimization**: Allocate space proportional to revenue potential, not just SKU count
2. **Marketing Investment**: Focus 60-70% of marketing spend on top 15 revenue categories
3. **Inventory Investment**: These categories justify higher stock levels despite capital cost
4. **Competitive Intelligence**: Monitor competitor pricing specifically in these categories
5. **Category Management**: Assign senior buyers to top revenue categories

---

## 9. Promotional Impact Analysis

### Finding: Strategic Discounts Generate Significant Customer Savings

![Discount Impact](charts/09_discount_impact.png)

**What This Shows:**
Categories with the highest average savings (3-15 AZN per product) include household cleaning products, baby care, and alcoholic beverages. These represent meaningful savings that influence purchase decisions.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Customer Perception**: Larger absolute savings (vs. percentages) create stronger value perception
- **Promotional ROI**: High-savings categories likely drive traffic and basket size
- **Category Roles**: These categories serve as "loss leaders" or traffic drivers

**Promotional Strategy:**
1. **Feature High-Savings Items**: Advertise absolute savings ("Save 15 AZN!") not just percentages
2. **Traffic Driving**: Use high-savings categories in weekly flyers and digital ads
3. **Basket Building**: Promote complementary full-price items alongside discounted products
4. **Margin Management**: Ensure promotional mix includes compensating full-margin sales
5. **Competitive Response**: Match or beat competitor discounts in these visible categories

---

## 10. Market Segmentation Dashboard

### Finding: Balanced Market Coverage Across All Segments

![Market Segmentation](charts/10_market_segmentation.png)

**What This Shows:**
Four-quadrant view reveals: (1) majority of products in 1-3 AZN range, (2) 74% at regular prices, (3) 99.5% in stock, (4) concentrated top categories.

**Why This Matters:**
This dashboard provides a complete health check:
